# WalkMe Homepage 🐾

**WalkMe** is a web-based landing page designed to bridge the gap between volunteers and the **"Friends on Four" (Chaverim Al Arba)** animal shelter. This platform facilitates the scheduling and management of dog-walking sessions, ensuring that every dog receives the exercise and human connection they deserve.
